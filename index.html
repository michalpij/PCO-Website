        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <img class="coding" src="images/coding.jpg" alt="Coding html"/>
        <p>This ICT programme has been om my mind for quite some time now. In the past 3 years I've been following a study programme in the finance sector. It had it's up's and down's, however one thing was certain.
          At the end of each year i came back to the question whether I should enroll into this current study. I have been fascinated by the internet and the technology behind it, however the finance sector seemed more lucrative at the time.
          I enjoy making en designing whatever i can, even more so if it helps me try out new things. Last year I've built my own PC, which ended up going suprisingly well considering my lack of knowledge and experience.
          This has also been the first activity in quite a while that got me hooked. I remember sitting at the desk at 4 a.m. in the morning, simply because I had a sudden idea to test out. I am strongly convinced that this study programme will prepare me well for my future career, aswell as show me a better view on this field of work.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <img class="meeting" src="images/meeting.jpg" alt="Business Meeting"/>
        <p>The demand for ICT skills is growing rapidly. As an emerging field, these jobs will generally also provide more leadership challenges and opportunities. The problem with financial jobs is the fact that I won't be able to stay motivated by doing the same thing over and over again for the next 50 years.
          The good thing about this study, and this field of work in general, is the fact that you can go a lot of different routes. I'm not yet sure who I want to be or what I want to do, but I'm sure this programme will provide me with the opportunities to find that out. Because of this, I'm hoping to learn a lot in the upcoming 4 years.
          I have also decided to switch from the Dutch course to the International one. This will hopefully improve my English pronounciation. I'm also hoping to increase my knowledge through hands-on courses.
