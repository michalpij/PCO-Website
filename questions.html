              <a class="accordion-link" href="#question1">How can you print a document from your laptop at HZ?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>First you need to connect with the printer. This used to be quite easy, however now you will probably need a new driver on your device. After downloading the driver, simply select the desired pages and send them to the printer.
                  Then you will have to go to the printer, scan your HZ pass and print out your documents. The printing isn't free so remember to put money on your card. This can be done at the dedicated points at HZ, one of them is located at the ground level, across from the room with the coffee machine.

              <a class="accordion-link" href="#question6">What are the instructions if you want to park your car at the HZ parking lot?</a>
              <div class="answer">
                <p>The parking spaces are located very close to the school. After passing the barriers next to the school, follow the signs to the dedicated HZ parking spaces. These spaces are marked with a white sign with the HZ logo.
                  It is also possible to charge a couple of electric cars there. From there you only have to walk about 300 meters to get to the school. REMEMBER! You need a HZ pass to enter the parking lot.</p>
