            <p>I choose this study mainly because i like working with hardware, but the career possibilities were also very appealing.
              It is predicted that the IT industry will add more then half a million jobs my the year 2029*.
              Network security seems like a great career path. I do not know particularly much about it, however it seems like a secure job. Hackers are the number one threat to businesses, this gives the impression that the security sector won't disappear in the future.
              I have also always enjoyed creating stuff, so i wouldn't mind spending my life on the creation en management of security infrastructure.
              Software engineering is also a valid option to look into. Making my own software would ofcourse be the best outcome, however it would also be great to work for a good and succesfull company.
              And last but not least, game development. Gaming has always been a hobby of mine, so making it my career doesn't seem like a bad idea. I am however only interested online- and console games. I never really saw the reason behind mobile games, it's great for a bit, but the limitations of the devices don't allow for much freedom or creativity.
